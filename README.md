# [Symfony Thin Controllers and FAt Models](https://medium.com/@muhammadtaqi/writing-thin-controller-fat-model-using-event-dispatcher-in-symfony-62371f4831c4)

The repo contains the code for this [article](https://medium.com/@muhammadtaqi/writing-thin-controller-fat-model-using-event-dispatcher-in-symfony-62371f4831c4). I tried to make our controller short and parition the logic into business and application.
Further I put all the business logic into Entities and Entity Managers and Application logic into EventListener and Services.
